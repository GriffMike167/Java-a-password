Third Repository - Java-a-password

I have created a Password Generator using javaScript.  This application generates a random password based on user-selections.  The application combines the HTML, CSS, and now Javascript tools we have been using so far. The user is asked to choose from the following: Character Type, Special characters, Numeric characters, Lowercase characters, Uppercase characters, Length of password

In this repository Javascript shows how its key within software development. If you are not following the prompts correctly you will be directed to start over with the set parameters to be able to achieve the goal of producing you a secure password.
